Advanced PCL / Bait and Switch
=====
This sample demonstrates the Advanced PCL / Bait and Switch technique through the creation of a mock database in an iOS Library. This sample also comes with a basic implementation of Mono.Data.Sqlcipher through the interfaces of the sample.

## About
The Bait and Switch PCL Trick is fully documented by Paul Betts. I urge anyone new to this to read his [blog post](http://log.paulbetts.org/the-bait-and-switch-pcl-trick/) before continuing.
