=====
The purpose of this sample is to demonstrate the use of Azure Mobile Services to send push notification on a Xamarin.iOS app.

Step by step instructions can be found at Microsoft's Azure Mobile Services [documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/partner-xamarin-mobile-services-ios-get-started-push/) for Xamarin.

### Overview of steps
1) Create Apple Certificates & Provisioning Profiles
2) Register with Apple Push Notification Service
3) Configure Azure Mobile Services

### Reminder
> Because of APNS requirements, you must deploy and test push notifications on an iOS capable device (iPhone or iPad) instead of in the emulator. -Microsoft Azure Mobile Services Documentation (Mimi Xu).
