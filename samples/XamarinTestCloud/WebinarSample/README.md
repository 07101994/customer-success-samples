WebinarSample
=====

WebinarSample is a simple cross-platform Xamarin.UITest project sample that allows
you to see automated testing in action. WebainarSample uses the built and included [VervertaCRM](https://github.com/xamarin/vervetacrm) iOS and Android app built with Xamarin. 

WebinarSample supports iOS and Android - each with UI tests written in C#.
It uses a local SQLite database to store the tasks, which are saved and read with SQL.

There are methods in the source code that are not called but are included for demonstration purposes.
