Xamarin.Forms Samples
=======

##### List of examples forthcoming.

Sample Requirements
====

* **Screenshots** - a folder called Screenshots that has at least one screen shot of the sample (preferably a screen shot for every page or every major functionality piece, people really key off these things). for the xplat samples, the folder should be split into platform folders, e.g. iOS, Android, Windows. see[ https://github.com/xamarin/mobile-samples/tree/master/Tasky/Screenshots](https://github.com/xamarin/mobile-samples/tree/master/Tasky/Screenshots) for an example of this.

* **Readme** - a[ README.md](http://readme.md/) file that has the name of the sample, a description, and author attribution. sample here:[ https://github.com/xamarin/mobile-samples/blob/master/Tasky/README.md](https://github.com/xamarin/mobile-samples/blob/master/Tasky/README.md)

* **.gitignore** - Please be sure to add a .gitignore file to your "packages" folder with the text below before committing any code! This cuts down significantly on the size of the repo.

```
*
!.gitignore
!repositories.config
```
