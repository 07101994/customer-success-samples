##Forms RedLaser Scanner	
This sample utilizes the [RedLaser Scanning component](https://components.xamarin.com/view/redlaser). It utilizes the MessagingCenter in order to provide the peices to enable scanning. It is also possible to do this with the DependencyService, but the best solution depends on your application use case.

This sample requires a RedLaser Scanner license to work.
