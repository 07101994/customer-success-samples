##Pac-Man Howling at the Moon
This sample is just a fun example of how we can play around with drawings. A ContentView is used along with a ViewRenderer to draw the desired image. Howl Pac-Man, Howl. If someone wants to make Ms. Pac-Man, I will buy you a beer. If you live in the US, I will ground ship you one of my homebrews.
