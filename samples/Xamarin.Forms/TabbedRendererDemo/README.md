##TabbedRenderer - Adding swipe feature to TabbedPage




This sample modifies Charels Petzold's TabbedPage sample (iOS and Android) to add TabbedRenderers with swipe gesture capabilities. The user is now able to swipe between tabs or tap on the specific tab. 

If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue against this sample and I will respond as soon as I can.
