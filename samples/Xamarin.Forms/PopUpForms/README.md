##Forms Popups
Sometimes you just need to create your own pop up dialog. We should feel free and flexible to do this with Xamarin.Forms controls because they are entirely native. Of course the simple AlertDialog is nice, but sometimes we want to show something else; maybe some details about something I just interacted with. This sample demonstrates a basic popup that is created with Xamarin.Forms controls when an image is tapped on. What a nice picture!
