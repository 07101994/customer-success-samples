##### This is where the Success Team houses code samples, projects, and other examples.

###### Please be sure to add a .gitignore file to your "packages" folder with the text below before committing any code! Also, add the .gitignore in the repo to your project to get rid of your bin/obj folders and some other stuff. This cuts down significantly on the size of the repo!

```
*
!.gitignore
!repositories.config
```
